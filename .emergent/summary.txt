The trajectory outlines the development of a large-scale, multi-tenant SaaS application, HexaBid, from an extensive problem statement. Initially, the AI engineer clarified the user's intent to build all 17 specified modules using a NestJS backend and React frontend.

The development process began with creating comprehensive architecture and API documentation. Following this, the AI scaffolded the entire backend and frontend, including project setup, database entities, and stub modules/pages for all features. A significant effort was made to establish a Docker-based environment for local development.

A key interaction involved the user raising concerns about errors. The AI responded by entering a verification phase, identifying and fixing build-time syntax errors in both the frontend (React/Zustand) and backend (NestJS/TypeScript) code.

Most recently, after fleshing out the BOQ and Product modules, the user provided a clear, multi-step roadmap: complete the OEM/RFQ modules, implement Google Authentication, and then build a company profile and email verification flow. The AI acknowledged this and was just about to begin implementing the OEM/Vendor module as the first step in this new phase.

<product_requirements>
The project is to build HexaBid, a comprehensive, multi-tenant SaaS platform for tender management and ERP. The application is designed to assist enterprises throughout the entire tendering lifecycle.

**Core Features Implemented/Scaffolded:**
- **Architecture:** A multi-tenant system with a NestJS backend and a React frontend.
- **Modules:** Scaffolding for 17 modules including Tenant Management, Tender Ingestion, Tender Workspace, BOQ & Costing, Product Catalog, OEM/RFQ management, and ERP features.
- **Authentication:** A JWT-based email/password login system has been created.
- **Core Functionality:** The BOQ (Bill of Quantities) and Product Catalog modules have been partially developed, with backend services and initial frontend UI (tables) implemented.

**Current User Request:**
The immediate goal is to build a complete user onboarding and core operational flow. This involves:
1.  Completing the high-priority OEM/Vendor and RFQ modules.
2.  Adding Google Authentication as a login option.
3.  Developing a flow for tenants to complete their company profile.
4.  Implementing email verification via a clickable link.
The user expects a fully functional application experience after this sequence is completed.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** NestJS (TypeScript framework)
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Zustand (state management)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (as per initial setup script)
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose
- **Architecture:** Multi-tenant SaaS, REST API
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a monorepo with separate directories for the backend, frontend, and documentation. It is designed to be run locally using Docker Compose.



- ****
  - **Importance:** Defines the services (backend, frontend, database) and their relationships, enabling a one-command startup of the entire local development environment.
  - **Changes:** Created to orchestrate the containerized services.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Contains the business logic for the Bill of Quantities (BOQ) module, handling creation, updates, and data manipulation.
  - **Changes:** A TypeScript error () was fixed. Initially, a property was assigned to another property on the DTO, which was likely read-only or of the wrong type. It was corrected to ensure type safety.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main user interface for viewing and managing BOQs. It's a critical page for the application's core functionality.
  - **Changes:** The file was created and enhanced from a basic stub to include a layout with a header and a placeholder for a data table, preparing it for displaying BOQ data.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Manages global authentication state (user, token) using Zustand, making it accessible throughout the React application.
  - **Changes:** A syntax error (an extraneous comma in the  middleware options) was fixed, which was preventing the frontend application from compiling.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
Based on the user's most recent request, the following high-priority tasks are pending:
- Implement Google Authentication for the login flow.
- Create the Company Profile creation and management module.
- Implement an email verification system using a link.
- Complete the full functionality for the RFQ (Request for Quotation) module.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a development and bug-fix cycle for the **BOQ (Bill of Quantities)** and **Product** modules.

**Work Done:**
1.  **Backend:** Created and enhanced the NestJS services, controllers, and DTOs for the BOQ and Product modules in .
2.  **Frontend:** Transformed the stub pages for BOQ and Products ( and ) into more structured components featuring headers and table layouts for data display.
3.  **Bug Fix:** Identified and fixed a TypeScript compilation error in  where a property assignment was invalid. After the fix, the backend compiled successfully.

The AI engineer has acknowledged the user's new, detailed plan and has just stated its intention to begin the next phase, starting with the OEM/Vendor module. The project is at a state where core backend logic and frontend UI for BOQ and Products are partially built and compile without errors, but are not yet fully functional or integrated.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will now begin building the complete OEM/Vendor module, including the backend controller, service, and DTOs, as it is the first step in the user's requested development sequence.
